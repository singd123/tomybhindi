                <p> <span class="time">here's to us, similing, laughing, shouting, chilling, fighting, crying, <br> all the good and ugly that 
                    makes you and me "us". </span><br> <br> <br> <br> 
             I don't know if i say this often but, I have been out there with different poeple, had my fair share of experiences, with you 
             and wihtout.But I can close my eyes and wihtout a second thought say that there is no one I would rather wait for as long as it 
             takes or be with, other than YOU! Now, I know i don't make it seem like that always, and every relationship has good days and bad 
             ones too. Yet, I know you're the first person i want to talk to when i get up and the last when i sleep, mostly ;). Because 
             for some reason there is just something is my gut which tells me that despite somedays the love between us being more and somedays
             less, there is nothing that is shaking me away from it.Not the one and half year where we didn't even talk, not the distance, 
             not the time difference, not what anyone says, nothing will ever make me not love you. Thank you for having my back, baring me and loving me, 
             hope we continue to do so forever. I love you Meri Bhindi!!!  </p>
